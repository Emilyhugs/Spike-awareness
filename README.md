# Spike Awareness

# Overview 

Spike Awareness is my first individual project developed as part of the Code Institute AI Augmented Full Stack Software Developer Bootcamp. Spike awareness is a static website that consists of HTML, CSS & Bootstrap and it aims to provide clear, easy-to-understand information about the safeguarding issue of spiking.
